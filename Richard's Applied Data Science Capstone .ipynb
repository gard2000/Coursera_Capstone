This project will find you that perfect spot.\n\nWhen your small B2C business requires a physical location for consumers to engage with you, selecting the right location for your small business concept is almost as important as the conept, branding, price, product placement, and promotions.  Imagine trying to make a Prada store successful in a rural nighborhood with an average income level of $25,000 per year.   Success is just not going to happen.\n\nBut where will my concept be successful?  That answer often lies in finding other succesful similar B2Cs, deternmining where there is a similar set of demographics and space left in the market place.  That search can be daunting, but with a little help from data analytics, you can find those locations that can support your B2C success: Demographics proven to support your B2C concept's success in a market that is not over crowded.\n\nWhile the right location will not ensure success, at least you will not be a Prada store in Duluth, AL."
